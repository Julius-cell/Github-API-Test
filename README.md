# Take-home-App

- This project was made to apply to [FullTime Force](https://fulltimeforce.com/) and with that objective we learned how to use the Api of Github.

- In this project you can see the commits history of this proyect, I know it's crazy right? 
- Here we are using the [GITHUB API](https://developer.github.com/v3) which it's awesome, provides a full documentation.

## Development server

- Download or clone the repository
- Run npm install
- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
- If you can't make more request, you can introduce your credentials in the github.service.ts file as indicated.
